SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.8.0 - End of Life

I am officially deprecating the SMITE Optimizer. Despite the thousands of dollars my passion project generated for Hi-Rez Studios, Inc. and Titan Forge Games, and the significant reduction in support tickets it provided, I have been treated with complete disregard and disrespect. My efforts were aimed at improving the community and enhancing the game, but their response has been nothing short of disheartening. As a result, I can no longer justify maintaining this tool. Thank you to everyone who supported my work.

This will be the last official version of the SMITE Optimizer. This update prepares the program for the imminent shutdown of the update and metrics servers.
You can continue using the program as normal. It can be acquired here: https://github.com/MeteorTheLizard/SMITE-Optimizer going forward, however no more updates will be released.

- Updated discord button to redirect to the rebranded SMITE-Optimizer discord server.
- Completely removed automatic update functionality.
- Completely removed metrics functionality.
- Updated copyright tab to reflect end of life changes.

- Fixed incorrect use of the "DisplayErrorMessage" function when fixing EasyAntiCheat and no installation files could be found.
- Removed buttons "Create quicklaunch bypass" and "Install legacy launcher" from the fixes tab.
- Repositioned button "Repair EasyAntiCheat"





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.7.9
- Updated HelpText for DirectX 11. (Community Contribution)
- Updated fix EasyAntiCheat now uninstalling it first before installing it. (Community Contribution)
- Updated E-Mail address in the copyright tab.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.7.8

Starting note:
Hi-Rez Studios has modernized SMITE drastically with patch 11.4. They have merged both the Steam version and the Epic Game Store version of the game into one repository. Both integrations are loaded now if you have both Steam and Epic Game Store installed on your system. The "-nosteam" and "-noepic" parameter were removed, and the log-in functionality of the game has been restricted to only authenticate when launching through Steam or Epic Game Store. This broke the Quicklaunch Bypass and Legacy Launcher of the SMITE Optimizer. It is possible to still launch the game without any integrations with some small tweaks to the shortcut that is created by the SMITE Optimizer, but you are not able to log in. It will always give you an error. On top of this, Hi-Rez is no longer supporting Windows 7, 8, and 8.1. This includes DirectX9 and 32-Bit support.
> TL;DR: DirectX11 and 64-Bit is now mandatory. Quicklaunch Bypass is broken forever.

- Removed "Quicklaunch Bypass" feature. (See starting note.)
- Removed "Install Legacy Launcher" feature. (See starting note.)
- DirectX11 and 64-Bit are now mandatory and forced to be enabled wherever applicable. (See starting note.)

- Fixed and updated the "Repair EasyAntiCheat" feature. (Community Contribution - Testing - Research)
- The donation tab now redirects to https://donate.meteorthelizard.com when clicked.
> All other donation tab code and resources were removed.

- Added new metrics: "error_fixes_eac_nosetup_eos", "error_fixes_eac_nosetup_both", and "action_donate_mtl_pressed"
- Metrics "error_fixes_eac_nosetup", "error_oldlauncher_installfailed", "error_quickbypass_code17", "error_quickbypass_code18", "error_quickbypass_noegsfound", "error_quickbypass_nosteamfound", "error_quickbypass_nosteamfound_path", "event_oldlauncher_installsuccess", "event_quickbypass_successegs", "event_quickbypass_successsteam", "action_kofi_pressed", "action_patreon_pressed", and "action_paypal_pressed" are now marked as deprecated and no longer used.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.7.7
- Added new setting "Disable Fog" to the fixes tab.
- Improved replacing of login information from the debug dump feature for improved security.
- Made some slight improvements to the "Common Issues" file.
- Fixed one-time crash on the first launch that happened on rare occasion.
- Implemented a new algorithm to verify configuration file integrity, faster speed and higher reliability.
> It is no longer possible to disable the verification step, as it is required for the optimizer to function.
> Removed "Check integrity/repair" from the Debug tab.
> "Buckets" are no longer modified by the program. Only the group that stores our active settings is modified.
- Metrics "action_automatic_repair_disabled" and "action_automatic_repair_enabled" are now marked as deprecated and no longer used.
- Made creating steam quicklaunch bypasses slightly more reliable by checking for the default installation path. (Community Contribution)
> If you experience errors, join the official Discord server. We're happy to help out.



Developer note:
Hi-Rez has added many new options to the .ini that could be changed to improve visuals or FPS even further.
Some values include TAA (Better antialiasing), optimizing tower/titan crumble physics, disabling SDKs (Logitech RGB, etc.), per-frame bias, and more.
There are currently no plans to add these to the SMITE Optimizer, but if demand is high enough, I'll consider it.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.7.6
- Updated copyright information. Happy new year!
- Added a new button to the "Fixes" tab that repairs EasyAntiCheat. (This requires administrator privileges.)
- Added new metrics: "action_fixes_eac", "error_fixes_eac_filedel", "error_fixes_eac_nogame", "error_fixes_eac_nosetup", "action_fixes_eac_success"
- Fixed blue pixels in some borders of the help tips.
- Updated DevTools "Template_Pics.xcf", "Template_Text_Compact.xcf", and "DevSettings.reg"





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.7.5
- Updated fonts for combo and input controls.
- Ensured to call NoTheme on input controls.
- Fixed style inconsistencies with the quicklaunch bypass popups.
- Added a new error message when trying to create a quicklaunch bypass for Steam, but the registry entries are invalid. (Community Contribution)
-> Added a new section to the CommonIssues.txt explaining what to do when the registry entries are invalid.
- Added new metrics: "error_quickbypass_nosteamfound_path", "error_font_code21", "error_font_code22", "error_updater_mtl_failed", "action_paypal_pressed"

- Updated the splash-screen to show which update provider is being contacted in real time.

- Fixed a bug with the resolution selector when an unavailable resolution was loaded. This usually happens when the display configuration changed.
- Metric "error_failed_screen_resolutions" is now marked as deprecated and is no longer used.
- Overhauled how resolutions are selected. Instead of relying on winmgmts which is limited to Full HD and often fails for no reason, you can now choose from a list of common resolutions or create a custom one!
- Implemented logic for custom resolutions. Selecting "Custom" in the resolution combo will now prompt you to input a resolution. Limited to: 800x600 - 15360x8640. The game does not support lower or higher settings.
> Please note that the game defaults to the nearest valid resolution to preserve a compatible aspect-ratio. "Random" resolutions such as "2100x1181" will not work.

- Added new update provider server, "update-so.meteorthelizard.com", for retrieving the .ini and .exe update files.

- Added metrics to the SMITE Optimizer.
> Added new clickable URLs to the Copyright tab, Privacy Policy, GDPR, and 'View SO-Metrics Online'.
> Privacy is our top priority. Specific actions, events, and errors in the SMITE Optimizer cause it to access a path on metrics-so.meteorthelizard.com.
> This increases the count for that action, event, or error by 1. When the SMITE Optimizer does that, it transmits your IP address, which is stored for a maximum of 1 week for security reasons.
> No other information is collected, and your IP address is not being shared. Learn more in the Privacy Policy / GDPR statement in the Copyright tab.
> All data that we collect and store can be viewed publicly by visiting: metrics-so.meteorthelizard.com, except for IP addresses.
> > Why collect metrics? - A: to potentially identify issues with the SMITE Optimizer and resolve them to improve the user experience.

SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.4.5
- Removed PayPal as a donation option.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.4.4
- For whatever reason Hi-Rez decided it is a good idea to store login information and the access token in the BattleGame.ini file, which I discovered today.
> This behavior is unacceptable as this file is packed when creating a debug dump.
> Steps have been implemented to ensure that this critical information is filtered out so that it is NOT being stored and sent.
> We are not interested in this information and it is a massive security risk as debug dumps usually get posted publicly.
> Critical information like this should NEVER be stored as plain-text. The fact Hi-Rez does this is laughable. It is highly recommended to NOT stay logged in to improve security.
> All of this only applies to users that are making use of the launcher bypass or the in-game log-in form.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.4.3
- Fixed a bug with the Desired FPS (Uncap) option always using the simple tab input even when in advanced mode.
> This made it so that changing the FPS uncap option in the advanced tab had no effect. Whoops.

- Changed error code 004 - 005 - 013 to be more descriptive. These errors happen when the optimizer could not write to the config files. Usually this happens when they're set to read-only mode.
- Changed error code 001 - 002 - 012 to be more descriptive. These errors happen when individual files of the config backup fail being copied. It now includes which file failed.
- Changed error code 003 to be more descriptive. This error happens when an internal error occurred during the config backup routine.
- Updated the system information box in the debug tab to be a bit larger to allow longer motherboard names to be displayed correctly. Thanks MSI and other manufacturers that do this!
- Added a checkbox to the debug tab that allows users to disable the integrity / repair routine. This never caused problems, but it can't hurt to have this option available.
- Updated reference hives for the integrity verification algorithm.
- Fixed an issue with the DevTool 'INIToAutoItHive.au3'
- Fixed spelling mistakes in the changelog.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.4.2
- Fixed a bug with the Ko-fi button in the 'Donation' tab





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.4.1
- Removed a few lines of unused code.
- Updated 'Donate' tab to include Ko-fi and removed the logo copyright notices as they were not needed legally.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.4
- Slight code optimizations
- Added error handler when you try to apply fixes before completing the configuration discovery process.
- The fixes tab will now remember your settings. Wow!
- Fixed configuration discovery for the Epic Game Store. (They made updates to how things work.)
- Implemented a new feature: Create Quicklaunch! (See next note)

- Updated Legacy Launcher installer notices (again)
> The legacy launcher still works at the time of writing this, installing it will download 9.3 when launching it.
> You can then copy Steam or Epic Game Store files over to the legacy install to update it to 9.4 and then launch the game normally.
> Eventually the legacy launcher will be completely shut down, meaning this method won't work anymore.
> It is recommended to use the new Quicklaunch bypass instead which launches the Steam or Epic Game Store version like the legacy launcher meaning you still have all the benefits.
> Additionally, since it uses official methods only, it is 100% 'legal' as in; Not violating the Terms of Service.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.3
- Updated information boxes when trying to install the Legacy Launcher. It is no longer officially supported by Hi-Rez Studios, but I'm not going to restrict users from installing it if they wish to do so.
- Added Website to Copyright tab.
- Changed update checkbox label "Perform Automatic Updates" > "Automatic Updates"
- Added a cheap status label to the Debug tab when creating a Debug Dump to let the user know what it is working on.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.2.1
- Added a notice when first launching the program when the standard path to the configuration files is invalid to tell the user to launch the game on their system at least once before doing anything with the program
- Added "paths" to the debug dump feature. This should have been there right from the start!
- Updated copyright information





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.2
- Added a new tab: Fixes. In this tab, you can apply fixes for common issues. Applying fixes are separate from other settings, allowing you to apply them without changing other graphics settings.
> New fix: Sounds cutting off (MaxChannels)
> New shortcut: FPS. You can set the FPS cap in the fixes tab now so that you don't have to make changes to other settings if all you want is a higher FPS cap. (QoL)
> New: Install Legacy Launcher Button. You heard right, the SMITE Optimizer now has a feature that allows you to install the old Legacy Launcher on your system. This feature is experimental and may not always work. Additionally, you will have to re-download the whole game through the launcher.
> (The downloaded files are from HiRez and are shipped to players through the Steam version (Steam\steamapps\common\SMITE\Binaries\Redist), they're official and 100% safe. )

- Updated the Vehicle Quality help popup as this option affects the Distance Line, Reticle, and Ground Target now. (Previously: Unused) - Reported by: WarpBurger

- Added the BattleGame / DefaultGame configuration files (This change requires ALL users to re-discover the configuration files)
> This file was added as there are more useful settings inside, one of them is required for the Fixes tab.
> Due to this file being added, previous configuration backups can no longer be restored and won't show up in the SMITE Optimizer.

Misc:
- Fixed spacing of menu item text
- Fixed spacing of "(Click to Continue)" text when applying the changes
- Fixed spacing of "Processing index of drive: (Drive letter)" text when using the automatic file discovery feature
- Fixed the spacing of the steam logo in the steam discovery button in the discovery tab
- Updated the DevTools/FontColors.txt to include the "Really bad" color
- Updated the Changelog.txt to fix formatting inconsistencies.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.52
- Made even more improvements to the update routine.
> The progress display is now fixed, no idea how I messed that up so badly. (Also made it display more information)
> The update.ini it downloads from GitHub or Pastebin is now 100% guaranteed to be up-to-date.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.51
- Made some Improvements to the automatic updater.
> Whenever the program was launched, the update information was downloaded from the internet (GitHub or pastebin).
> However, that information was then cached out of my control and whenever the program was launched again, instead of downloading the information fresh from the internet, it loaded the information from cache which was causing problems.
> The cached information was usually deleted on a proper shutdown of the system but due to Windows 10 not actually shutting down on a shut down, this cache was never reset until windows 10 did a full shutdown.
> (I'm so tired of windows, ngl.), this issue is now fixed.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.5
- Potentially fixed a crashing issue on launch when in Steam Mode.
> https://github.com/MeteorTheLizard/SMITE-Optimizer/issues/8#issuecomment-860125326

- Fixed the system information box in the debug tab not resizing properly.
- Added a label button to the debug tab that retrieves useful debugging information, this should help with future issues.
- Added support for custom document folder paths to the config discovery process.
- Fixed invalid file exist checks for OneDrive specific configuration discovery methods.
> (When OneDrive is installed, the configuration files may be stored inside of the OneDrive folder which causes problems, the check for the files whether they exist or not was erroneous but is now fixed.)





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.4
- Fixed a bug with the file integrity check routine that caused the program to crash when trying to apply changes to empty files. The program is supposed to add everything that is missing, which can be EVERYTHING if the file is empty.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.3
- Updated Copyright information.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.2
- Fixed discoloration of the window menu buttons (Close, Maximize, Minimize)





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.1
- Fixed 'Whole Scene Dominant Shadows' label in Advanced mode being cut-off.
- Fixed 'Verifying and repairing integrity' label in the apply changes progress window, being wrapped to the next line.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1
- This update introduces new fonts loaded from memory to prevent version incompatibilities.
> Previously, the program was loading system fonts that varied between Windows versions which caused spacing and label sizing issues.
> This update addressed this issue, fixing all cut-off text by changing the fonts for new ones.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3 (Code name: "The Future is here")

Compatible Operating Systems: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.
Please note that the program might still work perfectly fine on Windows XP and Windows Vista, however it was not tested, and they won't be officially supported. Expect bugs!

Most important changes:
The program is now open source and available on GitHub! (https://github.com/MeteorTheLizard/SMITE-Optimizer)
Version 1.3 and upcoming versions are licensed under the GPL-3.0 License.
Anyone may contribute to the code-base by creating a fork of the master branch and making changes to it. Once you are done, open a pull request.
Older versions than 1.3 are available on GitHub as well. Keep in mind that these versions are licensed differently.

Since the code of every version of the SMITE Optimizer ever released is now publicly available, there is no need for security concerns anymore.
The SMITE Optimizer always was virus-free and always will be.


Over the past few years from the point this project initially started, I have improved immensely in terms of writing efficient, understandable, and GOOD code.
The current state of the program and its code reflects my current coding skills, compared to V1.2.2, it is a massive difference and a re-write was desperately needed.
A re-write was also needed not just because the code was simply bad, but because the upcoming SMITE patch (7.8) will remove an option from the configuration files (bAllowFog) as it will now be enforced to always be true due to recent changes in HiRez' Terms of Service. V1.2.2 was not made with that in mind and will stop functioning once the patch goes live.

Do note that you're still allowed to tweak and make changes to the .ini (configuration files) as you please, which is all this program does.
The program is no longer capable of making changes to the (bAllowFog) variable to ensure that no one gets banned, even though re-adding that variable and changing it has no effect in-game.

For the past 3 weeks (It is currently the 9th of August 2020) I have been working on this rewrite, having spent at least 8 hours a day on it.
It is safe to say that it was an absurd amount of work and took a lot of dedication, time, sweat, blood, and stamina.

As previously mentioned, this version is a complete re-write of the SMITE Optimizer and features an overhauled and modern UI.
The SMITE Optimizer is now much more efficient in terms of code as well as optimizing the configuration files as I discovered new ways to efficiently optimize the game by tweaking settings.
The program is now able to detect corrupted configuration files, being able to fix almost any error or problem by itself as well as filling in missing settings. (bAllowFog excluded.)
The only thing it can't fix are settings that are set to malformed or incorrect values.


List of changes:
- Complete Code re-write.
- New modern UI with animations!
- Improved user friendliness as well as making things a lot easier to understand.
- Added Help tips for every single option that fades in when hovering over, explaining in detail what exactly it is and what effects it has on performance.
- Simple and Advanced mode, making it easier for people that don't know anything about game development.
- Added an animated splash-screen.
- New update routine that is a lot more efficient.
- Added an algorithm to find errors in the configuration files and repair them.
- More efficient way of applying the changes.
- More efficient and user-friendly way to restore backups.
- Updated Debug tab.
- Updates are now downloaded and applied automatically. (To disable automatic updates, you will now have to go into the debug tab)


The program and this update is free of charge.
