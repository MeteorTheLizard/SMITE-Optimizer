SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.51
> Made some Improvements to the automatic updater.
Whenever the program was launched, the update information was downloaded from the internet (github or pastebin).
However, that information was then cached out of my control and whenever the program was launched again, instead of downloading the information fresh from the internet, it loaded the information from cache which was causing problems. The cached information was usually deleted on a proper shutdown of the system but due to Windows 10 not actually shutting down on a shut down, this cache was never reset until windows 10 did a full shutdown. (I'm so tired of windows, ngl.), this issue is now fixed.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.5
Potentially fixed a crashing issue on launch when in Steam Mode.
> https://github.com/MeteorTheLizard/SMITE-Optimizer/issues/8#issuecomment-860125326

Fixed the system information box in the debug tab not resizing properly.
Added a label button to the debug tab that retrieves useful debugging information, this should help with future issues.
Added support for custom document folder paths to the config discovery process.
Fixed invalid file exist checks for OneDrive specific configuration discovery methods.
(When OneDrive is installed, the configuration files may be stored inside of the OneDrive folder which causes problems, the check for the files whether they exist or not was erroneous but is now fixed.)





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.4
Fixed a bug with the file integrity check routine that caused the program to crash when trying to apply changes to empty files. The program is supposed to add everything that is missing which can be EVERYTHING if the file is empty.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.3
Updated Copyright information





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.2
Fixed discoloration of the window menu buttons (Close, Maximize, Minimize)





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1.1
Fixed 'Whole Scene Dominant Shadows' label in Advanced mode being cut-off.
Fixed 'Verifying and repairing integrity' label in the Apply changes progress window being wrapped to the next line.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3.1

This update introduces new fonts loaded from memory to prevent version incompatibilities.
Previously, the program was loading system fonts that varied between Windows versions which caused spacing and label sizing issues.
This update addressed this issue, fixing all cut-off text by changing the fonts for new ones.





SMITE Optimizer Version 1.3 (Codename: "The Future is here")

Compatible Operating Systems: Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.
Please note that the program might still work perfectly fine on Windows XP and Windows Vista, however it was not tested and they won't be officially supported. Expect bugs!

Most important changes:
The program is now open source and available on GitHub! ( https://github.com/MeteorTheLizard/SMITE-Optimizer )
Version 1.3 and upcoming versions are licensed under the GPL-3.0 License.
Anyone may contribute to the code-base by creating a fork of the master branch and making changes to it. Once you are done open a pull request.
Older versions than 1.3 are available on GitHub as well. Keep in mind that these versions are licensed differently.

Since the code of every version of the SMITE Optimizer ever released is now publicly available, there is no need for security concerns anymore.
The SMITE Optimizer always was virus-free and always will be.


Over the past few years from the point this project initially started, I have improved immensely in terms of writing efficient, understandable, and GOOD code.
The current state of the program and its code reflects my current coding skills, compared to V1.2.2, it is a massive difference and a re-write was desperately needed.
A re-write was also needed not just because the code was simply bad, but because the upcoming SMITE patch (7.8) will remove an option from the configuration files (bAllowFog) as it will now be enforced to always be true due to recent changes in HiRez' Terms of Service. V1.2.2 was not made with that in mind and will stop functioning once the patch goes live.

Do note that you're still allowed to tweak and make changes to the .ini (configuration files) as you please which is all this program does.
The program is no longer capable of making changes to the (bAllowFog) variable to ensure that no one gets banned, even though re-adding that variable and changing it has no effect in-game.

For the past 3 weeks (It is currently the 9th of August 2020) I have been working on this re-write having spent at least 8 hours a day on it.
It is safe to say that it was an absurd amount of work and took a lot of dedication, time, sweat, blood, and stamina.

As previously mentioned, this version is a complete re-write of the SMITE Optimizer and features an overhauled and modern UI.
The SMITE Optimizer is now much more efficient in terms of code as well as optimizing the configuration files as I discovered new ways to efficiently optimize the game by tweaking settings.
The program is now able to detect corrupted configuration files, being able to fix almost any error or problem by itself as well as filling in missing settings. (bAllowFog excluded.)
The only thing it can't fix are settings that are set to malformed or incorrect values.


List of changes:
-Complete Code re-write.
-New modern UI with animations!
-Improved user-friendliness as well as making things a lot easier to understand.
-Added Help tips for every single option that fades in when hovering over, explaining in detail what exactly it is and what effects it has on performance.
-Simple and Advanced mode, making it easier for people that don't know anything about game development.
-Added an animated splash-screen.
-New update routine that is a lot more efficient.
-Added an algorithm to find errors in the configuration files and repair them.
-More efficient way of applying the changes.
-More efficient and user friendly way to restore backups.
-Updated Debug tab.
-Updates are now downloaded and applied automatically. (To disable automatic updates you will now have to go into the debug tab)
