Update V1.1.9 > V1.2

Quality of Life:

-Added a button to the "Restore Configuration" tab that deletes all of your old config backups.

Help updates:
-Updated the Program Functions to say SO and SMITE Optimizer Subreddit instead of SRGG and SRGG Subreddit.
 ^It will also tell you that you can press the button "Delete all backups" to delete all of your old config backups now.
-Added a line in the Variable Explanations that you can send me more accurate ones if you so desire.

-Fixed the program for steam users
 ^I have finally fixed the program for steam users, it should now properly optimize the game for you.

World Settings:

-Added Fog (Conquest and other)
 ^to disable fog. Works for Conquest (Jungle and background) and other maps with fog. (False = disabled | True = enabled)

Quality Of Life:
-Scanning for configs has been made optional. If you start the program for the first time or have reset your locations you will be prompted with a message box asking what version of SMITE you have installed. 
If the program finds the config at the pre-defined locations you don't have to run the scan anymore. 
However if it cannot find the configs it will still do the scan.
-You can now close the debug GUI by simply clicking the 'x' instead of 'opening' it again. derp.
