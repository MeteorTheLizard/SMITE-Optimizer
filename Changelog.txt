Update V1.1.51 > V1.1.6.

On the very first start of the program, the program will scan ALL DRIVES for configs. This process can take a while.
This is to avoid the classic "Could not find SMITE Configuration" error.
It is literally impossible now that the program can't find configs... Unless you don't have SMITE installed. // Deleted ALL of them

Client Settings:
-Added "Use DirectX11".

Misc:
