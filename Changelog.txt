Update V1.1.8 > V1.1.9

World Settings:
-Removed bAllowFog, (As there are more variables that need to be tweaked for fog to disappear)
-Added Fog (Conquest and other)
 ^to disable fog. Works for Conquest (Jungle and background) and other maps with fog. (False = disabled | True = enabled)

Quality Of Life:
-Scanning for configs has been made optional. If you start the program for the first time or have reset your locations you will be prompted with a message box asking what version of SMITE you have installed. 
If the program finds the config at the pre-defined locations you don't have to run the scan anymore. 
However if it cannot find the configs it will still do the scan.
-You can now close the debug GUI by simply clicking the 'x' instead of 'opening' it again. derp.
