<p align="center"> <strong>A modern and powerful program to easily change the configuration files for <a href="https://www.smitegame.com/play-for-free/?ref=Meteor">SMITE</a> PC on Windows.</strong></p>
<p align="center"> <strong>Compatible with Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p align="center"> <strong>Windows XP and Windows Vista are not supported officially, but the program might work just fine.</strong></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>How to install & use the program</strong></h2>

<p align="center">Download the program by heading over to the <a href="https://github.com/MeteorTheLizard/SMITE-Optimizer/releases">releases</a> page and select the latest version. If you have a 32Bit operating system, download the 32Bit version. If you have a 64Bit operating system, download the 64Bit version.</p>

<p align="center">After you have successfully downloaded the program upon first time launching it, it is possible that Windows Smartscreen is preventing you from opening it. Click on 'More info' in the popup and then the 'Run anyway' button. The program will now launch unless your Anti-virus prevents it from doing so. After it launched successfully it will ask you where your configuration files are located. Simply follow the instructions.</p>

</p>

<p align="center">Everything else was designed to be easy to understand. Simply hover over an option and a help tip will pop into view, explaining in detail what the setting does and what the recommended action is.</p>

<p align="center">If you cannot be bothered to read the info for every single setting, you can press the 'Use high performance Settings' button and the program will set all options to the recommended values. After you've done that, simply hit 'Apply Changes' and the program will make changes to your configuration files, creating a backup of them before that.</p>

<p align="center">If you are unhappy with the results, you can go into the "Restore configurations" tab and restore your old configuration files.</p>
