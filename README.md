<h2 align="center"><strong>Using the Standalone Launcher post 9.4.</strong></h2>

<p align="center">You can install the old legacy launcher with the SMITE Optimizer using the official installation files provided by Hi-Rez Studios.</p>
<br>
<p align="center"><strong>We highly recommend using the quicklaunch bypass instead, though!</strong></p>

<h2 align="center"><strong>How to install & use the program</strong></h2>

<p align="center">You can download the program here: <a href="https://github.com/MeteorTheLizard/SMITE-Optimizer/releases">(releases)</a>. If you're unsure whether you need 64-bit or 32-bit, download the 64-bit version; if it doesn't run, try the 32-bit version.</p>

<p align="center">The SMITE Optimizer is not signed, so Windows Smartscreen might prevent you from opening it. Click on "More Info" in the popup and then the "Run Anyway" button. The program should now start. On the first launch, it will ask you where your configuration files are located. Simply follow the instructions.</p>

<br>

</p>

<br>

<p align="center">The SMITE Optimizer is designed to be easy to understand. You can hover over each setting, and a popup will appear describing what exactly the setting affects, as well as what we recommend and what it is set to by default.</p>

<p align="center">If you don't want to bother tweaking all settings, you can hit the "Use high performance settings" button, and the program will set everything to what we recommend.</p>

<p align="center"><strong>You can apply your changes by hitting the "Apply changes" button!</strong></p>

<p align="center">Whenever you apply changes, a backup of your configuration files is created that you can revert to at any time through the "Restore Configuration" tab if you're unhappy with the results or encounter issues.</p>

<br>

<h2><strong>Bug Reporting</strong></h2>

<p><strong>You can join our official Discord server and report the bug in the #report-a-bug channel!</strong></p>

Alternatively, you may create an <strong>issue</strong> on the <a href="https://github.com/MeteorTheLizard/SMITE-Optimizer/issues">issues</a> page to report a bug.

<p>It is recommended to create a debug dump and attach the output .zip file to the issue. You can create a debug dump by going into the debug tab in the SMITE Optimizer and then clicking on the "Create debug dump" text. The program will freeze while it is working.</p>
