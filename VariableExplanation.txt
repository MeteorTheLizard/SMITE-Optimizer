Here is a full list of what every variable does.
Please note that i don't use UE3 or Unreal Engine in general. These explanations might not be accurate.

FPS
---------------------------------------------------

bSmoothFrameRate - Enable or Disable framerate smoothing.

MinSmoothedFrameRate - The minimum Framerate to target.

MaxSmoothedFrameRate - the maximum Framerate to target.



Engine
---------------------------------------------------

MaxParticleResize - "The maximum allowed size to a ParticleEmitterInstance::Resize call. If larger, the function will return without resizing."

MaxParticleResizeWarn - See above, "If the resize request is larger than this, spew out a warning to the log"

MaxParticleVertexMemory - Determines how much memory can be used for particles, lowering this to 0 means goodbye particles.

MinimumPoolSize - I done a lot of googleing and found nothing. All i know is it increased FPS at 0

MaximumPoolSize - I done a lot of googleing and found nothing. All i know is it increased FPS at 0



World
---------------------------------------------------

StaticDecals - Are images projected on surfaces, mostly used as effects.

DynamicDecals - Moving images projected on surfaces, can change color depending on filters/background.

DecalCullDistanceScale - How far away Decals still get rendered. After a certain distance decals will no longer be rendered.

DynamicLights - Moving light, rendered in realtime.

DynamicShadows - Moving shadows, rendered in realtime.

LightEnvironmentShadows - Shadows produced by light.

CompositeDynamicLights - Multiple moving lights that produce one light source.

SHSecondaryLightning - Unsure what exactly this does, disabling this will improve performance though.

DepthOfField - See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_of_field

Bloom - See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom_(shader_effect)

bAllowLightShafts - "Light Shafts can be generated by directional lights to simulate real world effect of crepuscular rays, or atmospheric shadowing of atmospheric in-scattering."

Distortion - Material distortion effects, can make a huge impact on FPS.

DropParticleDistortion - Same as above just for particles.

LensFlares - If you don't know what this is you really shouldn't use this program.

AllowRadialBlur - Blurs the world at the edges of the screen making it look like you are running at lightspeed.

AllowSubsurfaceScattering - Allows models to have an extra surface to look more realistic.

AllowImageReflections - In short, water reflections. No need to go into further detail.

bAllowHighQualityMaterials - Exactly what it says. If set to false, any material that is bigger than a certain size will be scaled down to improve FPS.

SkeletalMeshLODBias - Level Of Detail for Character skeletons.

ParticleLODBias - Level Of Detail for Particles.

DetailMode - Same as World Detail settings in SMITE. 0 being low, 1 mid and 2 high.

MaxDrawDistanceScale - Max distance objects like gods, minions, ability effects and so on will be drawn.

ShadowFilterQualityBias - Quality for shadow filters, -1 doesn't allow filters.

MaxShadowResolution - Shadows that cover a huge portion of the map can have a really high resolution. This option will scale them down to improve performance.

MaxWholeSceneDominantShadows - Amount of prioritised shadows that can be rendered at once.

bAllowWholeSceneDominantShadows - See above, this options enables or disables it.

bUseConservativeShadowBounds - Unsure, it increases FPS when enabled.

bAllowRagdolling - What it says.

PerfScalingBias - Unsure, lowering the value increases FPS but reduces texture quality.

StaticMeshLODBias - Level of Detail for props.

bAllowDropShadows - Unsure, disabling this increases FPS.

AllowScreenDoorFade - Foliage rendered in realtime.

AllowScreenDoorLODFading - Level of Detail for disappearing foliage.

SpeedTreeWind - Moving trees rendered in realtime, disabling this will still render the trees but they no longer move.

ShadowTexelsPerPixel - Exactly what it says, how many Shadows texels are rendered per pixel.
